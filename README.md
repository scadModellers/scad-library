# Visionary 3D Model Library
The Visionary library contains 3D models in the areas of astronomy, microscopy, photography and electronics.
It uses scad-clj to generate OpenSCAD models which can then be exported to STL or other file formats supported by OpenSCAD.

# Rationale
OpenSCAD is a nice tool to programatically generate 3D models, e.g. for printing with 3D printers.
But the SCAD language is a description language, not a real programming language.

With [scad-clj](https://github.com/farrellm/scad-clj) models can be created in clojure and rendered as SCAD files to be displayed by OpenSCAD.
